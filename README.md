\
SLAPP is an application for working exercises from the [*Symbolic Logic*](https://tonyroyphilosophy.net/symbolic-logic/) textbook by Tony Roy (and maybe other texts too). In this version (3.0) SLAPP is sufficient for the production of exercises from (at least) the first volume of the text.
In addition there is checking for for derivation exercises in chapters 3 and 6.  And there is "contextual help" for the basic I- and E-rule systems of chapter 6.  Mac and PC install packages are available through the [SLAPP website](https://tonyroyphilosophy.net/slapp/).\
\
This version of SLAPP divides into three modules.  There is the main SLAPP Editor module, and adapted versions of the gluonhq [Emoji](https://web.archive.org/web/20250124123750/https://github.com/gluonhq/emoji) and [Rich Text Area](https://web.archive.org/web/20250124123750/https://github.com/gluonhq/rich-text-area).
The Rich Text Area makes possible the extended editing features of SLAPP.  At the same time the RTA is itself a work in progress and certain instabilities of it make their way into SLAPP.  Ideally SLAPP and the Rich Text Area will grow together to result in a stable project.\
\
The Symbolic Logic APPlication code is submitted as-is. It is a "retirement project" by an author professionally trained as a philosopher -- not as a programmer. It is likely that some features will set a software engineer's hair on fire. All the same, it may be a basis for continued contribution and improvement.
